        <!--
            An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value
            However, not all attributes require a value
            In this case, we used href (hyperlink reference) attribute 

            If the href attribute is present, 
            the browser will give the text a blue color and 
            underline it to signify it is a link.
        -->
        <!--To open links in a new tab use the target attribute and _blank-->
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">click me too</a>
        </p>
        <!--
            The rel attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.
            The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. 
            The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
            It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.
